order: 12

Benjamin Noble is a second year PhD student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
He will be presenting his paper, "Energy Versus Safety: Unilateral Action, Signaling, and Executive Accountability."


**Abstract**

Americans have always been skeptical of executive power.
Yet many see a role for the president in overcoming Congressional gridlock and polarization.
Will increasing executive power necessarily decrease accountability?
To answer this question, I develop a game theoretic model comparing voter welfare under two separation-of-powers regimes.
Two agents, an executive and unitary legislature, each either congruent with the voter or divergent from her interests, must jointly make policy.
In one regime, the president can only change policy by working with Congress; in the other, he may choose between the legislative or unilateral action.
Then, an election is held and the voter may independently reelect or replace her agents.
I find that unilateral action creates conditions for costly signaling, allowing the executive to reveal both his own and the legislature's type.
I characterize broad conditions under which increasing executive power enables voters to select more congruent representatives and achieve higher welfareâ€”despite the downstream risks of adverse policy implementation.
