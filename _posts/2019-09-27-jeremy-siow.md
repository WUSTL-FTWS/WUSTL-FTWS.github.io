Jeremy Siow is a second year PhD student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.

Jeremy will present his paper, \"Brokers and Parties in a Clientelist Web: Defection or Cooperation?\", which you can find [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cjq2puzvdcee0ij/Paper.Jeremy.Siow.pdf?dl=0).

**Abstract**

What are the conditions that sustain or inhibit cooperation between clientelist parties and brokers? Current models of party-broker relationship highlight the agency of political parties in hiring brokers to buy votes on their behalf, and to enforce compliance among voters. Typically, this relationship is analyzed as an adverse selection problem (i.e. asymmetric information between parties and brokers) or as a moral hazard problem where parties are unable to monitor brokers’ effort effectively. In this paper, I want to explore the conditions that support brokers’ decision to exit from this relationship. Put simply, I argue that brokers do possess some level of agency in deciding whether to partake in cooperative arrangements with a particular political party, or to take their business elsewhere.
