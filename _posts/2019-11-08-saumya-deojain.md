She will be presenting her project, "The effect of diversity on special interest group coalitions."

**Abstract**

We study the effect of diversity on stable coalition formation of special interest groups.
We construct a contest game between the coalitions of these (finite) groups which implements a type of public policy.
Each group has its own preference over which type of public policy is implemented. We say the further away groups' preferences are from each other the more "diverse" the society is.
When groups belong to a coalition, a rule is used to propose a single policy of the coalition.
Groups within the coalition then pledge a spending to the policy chosen.
The type of public good implemented depends on the policies chosen and the total relative spending of each coalition.
This creates a contest game between coalitions for the type of public good implemented.
We find that extreme groups within a coalition contribute the most in a stable coalition which more moderate groups within a group free ride on.
Also, in order for moderate groups to form stable coalitions with extremist groups, rules within a coalition must favour the preferred policies of the moderates.
We (want to) show that as special interest groups spread out further from each other, stable coalitions with extreme groups allow for more types of rules that choose policy within a coalition.
The intuition behind this is that as groups grow further apart free-riding within a coalition for a moderate group is more beneficial than splitting from the coalition and spending on their preferred policy alone.
Thus, a higher spread of preferences would allow for rules within a coalition that favour the extremist group's preferences more.
