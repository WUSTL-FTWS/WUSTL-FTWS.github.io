**Abstract**

The role of reports from a third party in many violent crime cases is crucial, as it is often the case that at least one other person besides a victim and the offender was present at violent victimizations.
This paper examines how the network structure of a community, especially with respect to the triad of the victim, the offender, and the witness, affects the witness's reporting incentive by a model of favor exchange network.
The main implication of the model is that an equally moral person can behave in a completely different fashion depending on where the person is located in the network, and the reporting decision is based on the impact of the offender on the witness's neighbors in addition to one's sense of morality.
Furthermore, the analysis of the reporting incentive can shed a light on how an offender chooses the victim with respect to the subsequent reporting possibility, thus providing a tool to identify vulnerable individuals in the network.
