JB Duck-Mayr is a PhD candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis studying judicial decision making.
You can find his website at [http://jbduckmayr.com/](http://jbduckmayr.com/).

He will present a work in progress on structural estimation of "case space" models of judicial decision making and extending case space models to acount for incomplete information.

**Abstract**

"Case space models" of judicial decision making are used to model "doctrinal politics," or in other words, how judges form policy and make decisions in a context where "policy" is a mapping from circumstances to outcomes, in contrast to many legislative models and earlier theoretic models of judicial decision making that model policy as a point in a space.
Although the case space model has spurred several theoretical papers, it has had little impact on empirical research in political science, largely because theorists in this area have done little to draw connections to related existing empirical work or provide guidance to empirical researchers.
I show a machine-learning technique, Gaussian process regression, can be used as a structural estimation model for case space games.
I then show that a vein of empirical research in judicial politics assumes a very restrictive case space game underlies their data generating process.
I finally explore extending case space models to deal generally with incomplete information using the Gaussian process technology.
