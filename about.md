The WUSTL Formal Theory Workshop is hosted by the Political Science Department.
We welcome participants (from any department) to present work at any stage of development.
We have a projector for more formal presentations, though we also engage in more informal discussion of circulated papers.
To join our mailing list or inquire about presenting, you can contact the current organizer, JBrandon Duck-Mayr, at j.duck-mayr@wustl.edu.
